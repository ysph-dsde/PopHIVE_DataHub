# ---------------------------------
# Blunt ends
# 1. Prune missing values near the max of the queried dataset.
# 2. Cut off at the max of the recently existing archive.




# ---------------------------------
# Add:
# - blunt ends, overlap consideration.
# - function to compile recent pull into one running file for harmonization.
# - QC to confirm column names, based on that runifexpired() function.
