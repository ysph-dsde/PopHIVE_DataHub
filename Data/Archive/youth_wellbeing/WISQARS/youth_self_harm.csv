"ᵅ CDC does not recommend using NEISS-AIP data for nonfatal firearm injury prevalence estimates at this time. Firearm injuries have distinct geographic patterns, and estimates can be imprecise or change over time when based on a small number of facilities. CDC is working with CPSC to update and expand the NEISS hospital sample (Go to “About Nonfatal Injury Data” to learn more).",,,,,,,,,,,,
